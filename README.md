Trying to implement some Minecraft textures in Minetest... this is my first texture pack so I don't know if it will work properly. But is sure seems to!

**What is changed:**
--
● Beds
<br>
● Buckets
<br>
● Carts
<br>
● Doors
<br>
● Dye
<br>
● Farming Stuff (bread, wheat, etc.)
<br>
● Fire
<br>
● Flowers
<br>
● Player Api
<br>
● Stairs
<br>
● TNT
<br>
● Wool
<br>
● Default Minetest Game Blocks (not sure if this will work on mods)**
<br>
● And much more!

**Bugs I've Found:**
--
● Some blocks still have the Minetest textures.
<br>
✓ The water isn't transparent. --// Fixed!
<br>
✓ "Sea water" is a really weird lavender blue color. --// Fixed!
<br>
✓ The grass looks a bit *too* green. --// Fixed!
<br>
● *Please* don't press "C"... the player file got messed up and... uh oh...
<br>

If you find any, just comment them.
Thanks for using this pack!
